{"keys":["Proposed by","Description","Image","Name"],"data":[[["Xiaoxiao Wu"],"Manipulation of electromagnetic waves, or photons, plays a central role in modern human society. To overcome stringent limits imposed on natural materials, we will focus on the research of photonic metamaterials, artificial microstructures designed by incorporating exotic physics, such as conformal transformation and band topology, to achieve full manipulation of photons. We will pay special attention to the THz-frequency photons, and explore their interactions with various quantum materials and devices.",["__site/assets/databases/dcbb0aa27be6422d986506c9db8a69e0/wxx.jpg"],"Photonic metamaterials"]]}
